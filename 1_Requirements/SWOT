1_Strength:
            These were introduced to solve problems with the existing manual systems.
            The automated Student Record Management system has many advantages over the manual system. 

            This can be explainas follow:

            The major benefit of the system is that it helps the staff to accomplish their daily functions more efficiently,
            and Limit the use of papers
            Quick access to the required information as it is only, one click away.
            It solves the problem of time consuming, since data is centralized
            It also enhances security as access to the system requires authentication. 
            This means that onlyauthorized users can access that system.

2_Weakness:
             The system is not web based therefore the user should create a backup somewhere else for securitypurpose
             The User finds it tiresome and time consuming when entering students details forevery department.
             
3_Opportunity:
               During the course of this project, the research was able to understand better
               what goes in the studentâ€™s records management system in a learning institution. 
               This was effectively done through reading ofliterature and research. 
               The whole process of developing the system was an opportunistic challenge.
               Seeing the system into a tangible system was a rewarding exercise. 

4_Threat:
          When data is stored in computers or laptops, it has become so natural that people lose the information 
          when files are accidentally deleted or even it could fall into the wrong hands. 
          Ensure a proper backup strategy to keep your data on important devices and run them smoothly without hassles.
